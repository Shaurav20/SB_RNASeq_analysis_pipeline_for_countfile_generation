## 🔄 Pipeline Steps

Data Acquisition: Download SRA files using prefetch and fasterq-dump

Quality Control: FastQC analysis of raw and trimmed reads

Read Trimming: Adapter and quality trimming with Trimmomatic

Reference Preparation: HISAT2 index building for GRCh38 chromosome 1

Alignment: Read alignment with HISAT2

Quantification: Gene counting with featureCounts

Analysis Preparation: Formatting count files for R/DESeq2

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Windows 10/11 with PowerShell administrator access

Minimum 50GB free disk space

8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. Windows Setup (PowerShell as Administrator)

Within windows powershell - Enable WSL and install Ubuntu

```
wsl --install -d Ubuntu 

# Set up SRA Toolkit (Windows installation)
# Download from: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit
```

2. Data Download (PowerShell)

Download SRA files (run in PowerShell)
```
prefetch SRR34712398
prefetch SRR34712393

# Verify files are downloaded
# Files will be in: C:\Users\[Username]\ncbi\public\sra\
```

3. Run Analysis Pipeline (WSL/Ubuntu)

Execute the complete pipeline script in WSL/Ubuntu terminal.

## 🚧 Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem 1: Windows Bioinformatics Tool Compatibility

Issue: Initial attempts to run bioinformatics tools (bowtie2, samtools, HISAT2) directly in Windows PowerShell failed due to:

Missing dependencies

Incompatible builds for Windows architecture

Environment variable conflicts

Slow performance with large genome indexing

Solution: Implemented a hybrid Windows/WSL approach:

Use Windows PowerShell for data download (prefetch/fasterq-dump)

Use WSL/Ubuntu for computational analysis

Leverage Linux-native bioinformatics tools with better performance and compatibility

### Problem 2: Genome Index Building Failures

Issue: Multiple attempts to build genome indices failed:

bowtie2-build on full GRCh38 genome stalled indefinitely

Memory exhaustion during index building

Incorrect file permissions in Windows-mounted directories

Timeouts due to large genome size

Solution:

Chromosome 1 Only Strategy: Initially built index for chromosome 1 only to test pipeline

WSL Optimization: Moved reference files to WSL-native storage (/home/ instead of /mnt/d/)

Resource Management: Added --offrate and --bmax parameters for bowtie2

Alternative Aligner: Switched to HISAT2 which has better memory management

### Problem 3: Conda Environment Issues

Issue: Multiple conda environment problems:

Channel conflicts between bioconda and conda-forge

Package version incompatibilities

Broken dependencies after installation

SAMtools installation failures

Solution:

Clean Environment: Created fresh rnaseq_clean environment

Strict Channel Priority: Set conda config --set channel_priority strict

Sequential Installation: Installed packages in dependency order

Alternative Installation Methods: Used mamba for faster dependency resolution

### Problem 4: WSL/Windows File System Performance

Issue: Poor performance when accessing Windows files from WSL:

Very slow file I/O on /mnt/d/ mounted drives

Permission issues with Windows-created files

File locking conflicts between Windows and WSL

Solution:

Work in WSL Native Storage: Perform computation in /home/user/ directories

Copy Before Processing: Move files from /mnt/d/ to WSL-native storage before analysis

Use WSL-native Tools: Install bioinformatics tools in WSL, not Windows

Avoid Concurrent Access: Don't access same files simultaneously from Windows and WSL

### Problem 5: Quality Control Challenges

Issue: Initial FastQC reports showed several quality issues:

Overrepresented poly-G sequences (likely technical artifacts)

Adapter contamination

Poor quality bases at read ends

Solution:

Custom Trimming: Added custom poly-G sequence to Trimmomatic adapters file

Head Crop: Implemented HEADCROP:12 to remove poor quality bases

Multi-step Trimming: Used dual ILLUMINACLIP for both adapters and poly-G sequences

Post-trimming QC: Run FastQC after trimming to verify improvement

### Problem 6: Alignment Rate Issues

Issue: Low alignment rates (~14%) when using chromosome 1 only:

Most reads couldn't align to single chromosome

Expected for whole-transcriptome data aligned to partial genome

Solution:

Pipeline Validation: Confirmed pipeline works despite low alignment rate

Documentation: Clearly noted this is expected behavior for testing

Production Readiness: Pipeline validated and ready for full genome analysis

Alternative Explanation: Low alignment rate is correct for chromosome 1-only alignment

## 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

1. Hybrid Windows/WSL Architecture

Decision: Use Windows for data download, WSL for computation
Rationale:

SRA Toolkit works well in Windows

Bioinformatics tools perform better in Linux

Best of both operating systems

2. Chromosome 1 Testing Strategy

Decision: Test pipeline on chromosome 1 before full genome
Rationale:

Faster iteration during development

Lower resource requirements

Validates pipeline before committing to full analysis

3. HISAT2 over bowtie2

Decision: Use HISAT2 as primary aligner
Rationale:

Better memory management

Built for RNA-Seq with splice-aware alignment

More reliable index building

4. featureCounts for Quantification

Decision: Use featureCounts from subread package
Rationale:

Fast and efficient

Works directly with SAM files (no BAM conversion needed)

Well-documented and widely used

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Read Processing: ~56 million read pairs per sample

Trimming Efficiency: ~95% read survival rate

Alignment Rate: ~14% (chromosome 1 only - expected)

Processing Time: ~4-6 hours per sample on test system

## 🚀 Next Steps for Full Analysis

Download complete GRCh38 genome reference

Build full HISAT2 genome index

Run complete alignment (expected alignment rate >70%)

Perform differential expression analysis with DESeq2

Conduct pathway and functional enrichment analysis

## 📝 Conclusion

This pipeline successfully overcomes multiple technical challenges through a hybrid Windows/WSL approach, careful resource management, and iterative testing. The validated pipeline is now ready for production-scale analysis on complete genomes.
